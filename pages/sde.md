### Introduction to SDEs


A stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a differential equation 
in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process,[1] resulting in 
a solution which is also a stochastic process. SDEs have many applications throughout 
pure mathematics and are used to model various behaviours of stochastic models such as stock 
prices,[2] random growth models[3] or physical systems that are subjected to thermal fluctuations.


SDEs have a random differential that is in the most basic case random white noise calculated 
as the derivative of a Brownian motion or more generally a semimartingale. However, other types 
of random behaviour are possible, such as jump processes like LÃ©vy processes[4] or semimartingales 
with jumps. Random differential equations are conjugate to stochastic differential equations. 
Stochastic differential equations can also be extended to differential manifolds.[5][6][7][8]
